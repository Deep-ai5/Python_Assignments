This repository contains two simple Python scripts demonstrating how to use functions and the Python math module for fundamental calculations.

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
Returns the calculated factorial and prints the output with a sample number.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Asks the user for a number as input and uses Pythonâ€™s math module to calculate:
The square root of the number
The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
The sine of the number (in radians)
Displays the calculated results.
