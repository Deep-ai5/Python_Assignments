This repository contains two simple Python scripts demonstrating the use of conditionals and loops for basic problem-solving.

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Takes an integer input from the user, checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement, and displays the result.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50, calculates the sum of all integers in this range, and displays the final sum.
