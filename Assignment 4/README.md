This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating file handling and exception handling in Python.

Task 1: Read File Content with Error Handling
Reads the contents of a text file named sample.txt line-by-line.
Adds line numbers to each printed line.
Handles the case where the file does not exist, printing a friendly error message.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Takes text input from the user and writes it to output.txt (overwriting existing content).
Takes additional text input from the user and appends it to the same file.
Displays the final file content.
