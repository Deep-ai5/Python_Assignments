This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating dictionary operations and list slicing in Python

Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks if the student exists in the dictionary.
If the student's name is not found, displays an appropriate message.

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
Extracts the first five elements using list slicing.
Reverses these extracted elements.
Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.
